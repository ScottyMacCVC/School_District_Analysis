# School District Analysis & Thomas High School Revisions

## The School District has asked for a set of deliverables to analyze their school district. We will present a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics. Using a table format, the chart will show the Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate. We will measure the average math & reading score received by students in each grade level at each school. We will look at the school performance based on the budget per student, school size, and type of school. To evaluate the students performance within each school, we need to determine the passing grade, gather the number of students who passed math and reading, convert the percentage of students who passed math and reading into an overall passing percentage. During our review, Thomas High School's 9th grade created an anomoly and we will explain the affected results below.

## Results and Thomas High School's 9th Grade
 - How is the district summary affected? The district summary was inaccurate. Thomas High School's 9th grade data was incomplete. Because the data was incomplete, Thomas High School was one of the lowest scoring schools. But if we remove the 9th grade, we find the Thomas High School is one of the top performers. 
 - How is the school summary affected? The school summary was inaccurate. The passing rate dropped to the 60 percentile, but the mean scores appeared to be high. There is typically a direct correlation between a higher mean score and the number of students passing. When we removed the 9th grade due to incomplete data, we see the percent passing greatly improve. 
 - Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affected Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools greatly. Once we removed the 9th grade from the overall school calculation, we see the school in the top 5 schools of the district. 
 - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores for the 10th to the 12th grade will be unaffected by the change. But we will see a correction for the 9th grade. The averages for the 9th grade in the district and all schools will need to be updated.  
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type
